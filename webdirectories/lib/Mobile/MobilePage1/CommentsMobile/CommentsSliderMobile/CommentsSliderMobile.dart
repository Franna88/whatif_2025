Johan and his team is always honest and upfront about the cost, and they do a great job. I highly recommend the Panel Beater Directory to anyone looking to find a reliable auto body repairer.”",

A quick Google search led me to your Towing Directory. The tow truck driver I contacted was very understanding and helpful. He towed my car to a nearby garage and even helped me to file a claim from my insurance company. I was so impressed with the service I received, and I’m really glad I found them on your website! Thanks. “",
